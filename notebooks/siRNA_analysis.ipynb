    "1. **Refine Data Parsing:** Develop more robust parsing functions for the GEO series matrix to extract sample-specific expression data.\n",
    "2. **Sequence Extraction:** Use the reference genome and gene annotations (e.g., from ENSEMBL) to extract nucleotide sequences for key genes.\n",
    "3. **Model Fine-Tuning:** Prepare a labeled dataset and fine-tune the DNABERT_2 model for on-target/off-target classification.\n",
    "4. **Advanced Visualization:** Generate attention heatmaps and sequence logos to interpret key motifs identified by DNABERT_2.\n",
