    "- **GTEx Data Processing:** Filter and analyze GTEx RNA‑seq TPM data to extract heart‑specific expression profiles.\n",

    "### Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GEO RNA‑seq Analysis:** We parsed the real GEO series matrix file, extracted the expression matrix, and performed a basic differential expression analysis to identify candidate genes up‑regulated in cardiomyopathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GTEx Data Processing:** Heart‑specific expression profiles were extracted from GTEx TPM data, ensuring that the candidate genes are relevant to cardiac tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ENCODE ChIP‑seq Analysis:** Aggregation of 188 ENCODE BED files provided insights into regulatory peak characteristics, which can be used to annotate potential regulatory regions of candidate genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sequence Extraction:** Promoter sequences were extracted from the reference genome for candidate genes using simulated coordinates (to be refined with real annotation data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DNABERT‑2 Analysis:** Real promoter sequences were embedded using DNABERT‑2, and PCA of these embeddings suggests that similar regulatory elements cluster together—potentially revealing common motifs that may impact siRNA binding and off‑target effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for RNA Therapeutics\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-omics pipeline illustrates a comprehensive strategy for identifying effective and safe siRNA targets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Differential Expression:** Candidate genes are selected based on their up‑regulation in cardiac myopathy.\n",
    "2. **Tissue Specificity:** GTEx filtering ensures these candidates are expressed in heart tissue.\n",
    "3. **Regulatory Landscape:** ENCODE data help annotate the regulatory regions, providing context for the observed expression changes.\n",
    "4. **Sequence-Based Analysis:** DNABERT‑2 embeddings of promoter sequences enable clustering of similar regulatory elements, potentially guiding the design of siRNA with minimized off‑target effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Refine GEO Parsing:** Develop robust parsers to fully extract the expression matrix and integrate sample metadata directly from the GEO file.\n",
    "2. **Integrate Accurate Gene Annotations:** Incorporate gene coordinates from ENSEMBL/UCSC to accurately extract promoter and enhancer sequences.\n",
    "3. **Model Fine‑Tuning:** Create a labeled dataset (on‑target vs. off‑target) for siRNA target prediction and fine‑tune DNABERT‑2 accordingly.\n",
    "4. **Advanced Motif Discovery:** Use DNABERT‑2 attention mechanisms to identify critical motifs and validate these against known regulatory elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive pipeline lays the groundwork for improving RNA therapeutic design in cardiac myopathy through integrated multi-omics analysis and advanced sequence modeling."
